        		<h1> Geography Coursework - The Sitges authorities are sleep walking into disaster </h1>
				<p> As part of my A-Level Geography course I am required to create a 4000 word document
					In July 2017 we visited the town of Sitges, located within Catalonia, east of Barcelona. 
					While we were there we undertook fieldwork on the beaches. Sitges, and the Catalonian coastline overall,
			is struggling significantly with coastal erosion. Defences have been set up over the years and our task was aimed
			at concluding how successful they have been.</em></p>
