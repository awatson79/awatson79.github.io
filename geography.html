    <h2>Basic Info</h2>
    <p>As part of my A-Level Geography course I am required to create a 4000 word document
	In July 2017 we visited the town of Sitges, located within Catalonia, east of Barcelona. 
	While we were there we undertook fieldwork on the beaches. Sitges, and the Catalonian coastline overall,
	is struggling significantly with coastal erosion. Defences have been set up over the years and our task was aimed
	at concluding how successful they have been.</p>

    <h2>Fieldwork</h2>
    <p>To assist me with my coursework I used numerous fieldwork techniques:</p> 
    <p>First of all, at a location towards the west of the town, we measured both the size (through the pebble's long axis) and orientation of the pebbles.
	this technique was used to find the direction of longshore drift. Theoretically pebble size should decrease with longshore drift, and orientation should be aligned in the same direction.
	  </p>
    <p> Secondly, at the beaches directly within the town, we performed a number of beach assessments. These included measuring:
	    -beach profile
	    -beach width
	    -beach depth
	    -promenade length
	all of these were used to help get a clear picture of which defences are working and which aren't <p/>

    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
    <p>It is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
